Application Description:
The user profile CRUD application is a web-based system that allows users to perform CRUD operations on their profiles. Built using Visual Studio Code, Spring Boot, and React.js, it offers a seamless and efficient user experience.

Features:

Create Profile: Users can create new profiles by providing necessary information such as name, email, and password.
Read Profile: Users can view their profiles along with their details.
Update Profile: Users can edit their profile information, including name, email, and password.
Delete Profile: Users can delete their profiles if needed.
Technologies Used:

IDE: Visual Studio Code provides a robust development environment with powerful tools and extensions.
Backend: Spring Boot, a popular Java-based framework, is used to develop the RESTful API endpoints for handling CRUD operations on user profiles.
Frontend: React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is used to create a dynamic and responsive frontend for interacting with the backend.
Development Workflow:

Backend Development: Using Visual Studio Code, developers work on the Spring Boot application, implementing RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on user profiles. This includes setting up database connections, defining data models, and creating controllers to handle HTTP requests.
Frontend Development: Simultaneously, developers use Visual Studio Code to build the React.js frontend. They design user interfaces for profile creation, viewing, updating, and deleting using components and state management.
Integration: Once both the backend and frontend are developed, they are integrated to ensure seamless communication between them. RESTful API calls are made from the React.js frontend to interact with the Spring Boot backend.
Testing and Deployment: The application undergoes thorough testing to ensure functionality and reliability. Once tested, it is deployed to a server or cloud platform for public access.
This application empowers users to manage their profiles efficiently while demonstrating the capabilities of Visual Studio Code, Spring Boot, and React.js in modern web development.
